# weather_bot
A simple weather bot for Discord

I commented what you need to do in the code but I'll also list it here

YOU NEED TO DO:
1) make a bot through the Discord Developer Applications page
2) copy and paste your bot's token into the `client.login` method (I commented where)
3) Create an account over at https://openweathermap.org/ and get an api key
4) copy and paste api key in the `api_key` variable (I commented where)
5) Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
6) Open command line and change directories into the project files
7) Run the bot through the command line by typine node app.js

Once you're done that, the bot should be good to go.
`!weather zip_code` to use the bot. Message me if you have any questions :)
